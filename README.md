# haskellite

Haskell-like functionality for Dart

## Features

 - ✅ Open Source
 - ✅ Fully Tested and Documented
 - ✅ Lightweight
 - ✅ Pure Dart (no Flutter dependencies)
 - ✅ Cross-platform
 
## Types

 - `Maybe<T>` - Represents a value or the absence of a value. 
 - `Either<L, R>` - Represents a value of type `L` or a value of type `R`
 - `Result<T>` - Represents the result of a computation, either succeeding with a value, or failing with an error
 - `RandomVariable<T>` - Describes a variable with a random component, allowing for lazy evaluation and other utilities (convenient reuse/caching/mocking). Inspired by Haskell's strict handling of randomness
